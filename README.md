# IOT-System-for-Car
A system using concept of IOT to alert the car owner whether driver is drunk or not  with its position coordinates.

A PRODUCT TAILOR MADE FOR OUR CAR & FAMILY WITH A PERSONALIZED 'WATCHMAN' 
INSTALLED IN OUR CAR TO KEEP OUR LOVED ONES SAFE

	INTRODUCTION:

1)	THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ADVISING ITS CITIZENS NOT TO DRINK AND DRIVE FOR DECADES, BUT WE ARE NOT FOLLOWING IT PROPERLY AND FACING SERIOUS ACCIDENT ISSUESS IN THE WORLD.
2)	ALSO WHEN THE CAR IS HANDED OVER TO A DRIVER, CAR OWNERS  ARE NOT MAKING ATTENTION TOWARDS CARS DIFFERENT PARAMETERS AND DRIVERS HABITS OF DRINKING ALCOHOL.
3)	ALSO FOR ACCIDENT ALERT OR FOR SECURITY FROM THEFT WE CAN TRACK OUR CAR LOCATION.
4)	SO IT WILL BECOME IMPORTANT TO TRACK A REAL TIME LOCATION AND DIFFERENT PARAMETERS OF CAR, WHICH CAN BE EASILY IMPLEMENTED BY IOT CONCEPT.
5)	SO,WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A SMALL PROTOTYPE FOR TRACKING  A REAL TIME LOCATION OF CAR AND ALERT SYSTEM FOR VERIFICATION OF DRIVER, WHETHER HE IS DRUNKED OR NOT. 

	WORKING:

1)	THE FIRST IS A BREATHALYZER SYSTEM LOCATED EITHER ON THE STEERING WHEEL OR THE DRIVER’S SIDE DOOR THAT IS CAPABLE OF DETECTING ALCOHOL IN THE AIR PARTICLES AROUND IT. THIS MEANS THAT EVEN IF THE DRIVER DOESN’T HAVE THE FORESIGHT TO BLOW INTO THE DEVICE, OR DOESN’T WANT TO, THE SYSTEM WILL STILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW MANY DRINKS HE OR SHE HAS IMBIBED.
2)	AFTER SENSING IT WILL COLLECT GPS PARAMETERS FROM SENSOR SERIALLY.
3)	AFTER SENSING PRESENSE OF ALCOHOL IT WILL SEND PARAMETERS TO NODE RED, WHERE IT WILL GET PROCESSED AND SENDS THE PARAMETERS TO DISPLAY ON WEB PAGE.


	APPLICATION:

1)	GET REAL TIME UPDATES ON EVERY MOMENT OF OUR CAR ON ANDROID PHONE OR WEB PAGE.
2)	WE CAN FIND OUT OUR CAR EASILY IN GIANT PARKING SPACE.
3)	WE WILL GET INSTANT ALERT UPDATES OF WHETHER DRIVER IS DRUNK OR NOT.

 
	ADVANTAGES:

1)	WE ARE USING A NODE RED WHICH IS A FUTURE OF INDUSTRIAL IOT.
2)	WE CAN EASILY INTERFACE MICROCONTROLLER WITH CLOUD AND VIEW ON WEB PAGE LIKE FREEBOARD OR THINGSSPEAK.
3)	GATHER AND MAKE THE DATA AVAILABLE IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
4)	THIS DATA CAN BE SHARED WITH POLICE AND COURT IN CASE OF ANY EMERGENCY ETC. 
5)	THIS DATA CAN BE USED BY THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURE TO    
IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND OTHER DESIGN FACTORS.
6)	THIS CAN BE USED BY THE R&D ENGINEERS TO UNDERSTAND THE 
DYNAMICS OF VEHICLE IN BETTER WAYS.

	DISADVANTAGES:

1) WE WILL NEED AN INTERNET CONNECTION FOR TRANSMITTING PARAMETERS.
2) CIRCUIT COMPONENT IS VERY MUCH COSTLY FOR A SINGLE PRODUCT, BUT FOR MASS PRODUCTION SOC WILL REDUCED THE COST VERY EFFECTIVELY.

	FUTURE SCOPE:
1) WE CAN ADD MORE SENSOR FOR ANALYSIS OF TEMPERATURE AND HUMANITY INSIDE ENGINE, SPEED OF THE CAR, LEVEL OF PETROL TANK etc.
2) WE CAN CREATE A VITUAL BOUNDARY i.e. GEO FENCE TO PROTECT OUR CAR FROM THEFT AND WILL GET A INSTNT ALERTS.
